# Dmitry Starodubtsev
Full-stack engineer building AI-powered hiring platforms and high-load B2B systems.

## Professional Work
**Software Developer Intern @ APS Data Technologies** | April 2024 - Present  
Building production AI-powered ATS systems processing 1000+ applications daily for K-12 school districts.

### Key Systems I've Built (Under NDA)

**AI-Powered Application Screening System** → [**See Demo**](https://github.com/stdmitry04/aps-main-demo)
- RAG-based chatbot with vector embeddings for intelligent document processing
- OCR pipeline extracting structured data from unstructured documents (transcripts, resumes, letters)
- Automated applicant routing reducing manual review time by 60%
- Tech: Next.js, Django, Qdrant, OpenAI API, Docker

**Admissions & Onboarding Platform** → [**See Demo**](https://github.com/stdmitry04/campus-usa-demo)
- React/Next.js platform supporting 500+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime
- Real-time interview scheduling with automated email workflows
- Multi-stage offer management with role-based permissions
- Tech: Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker

**📊 Impact:** Processing 1000+ applications/day across multiple school districts. System maintains 99.9% uptime during peak hiring seasons (Aug-Oct).

> ⚠️ **Note:** The full production systems are proprietary. The demo repositories show core architectures I built:
> - [**campus-usa-demo**](https://github.com/stdmitry04/campus-usa-demo): AI document processing & RAG chatbot
> - [**aps-main-demo**](https://github.com/stdmitry04/aps-main-demo): Applicant tracking & hiring workflows
>
> Production systems include additional microservices, enterprise integrations (DocuSign, ERP), and multi-tenant infrastructure not shown in demos.
